so for the user recipes
only one user must have access to that recipe to make edit and changes?

I have one for users
I need to make one for the dishes
Do I need to make a model for users_to_recipes?
    Maybe use session to have users id and recipes id
        We would have to pop recipes id if they cancel or submit the dish

Future Ryan:
Recreate the tables for two tables
    make sure the session user_id
